# catch-the-meat
The game is inspirate by One Piece anime. Here you need to catch the meat and dodge knifes as Luffy 
while looking for the devil fruits to increase your health and your score.
You have 3 health points at the start. The game is over when 

I'd made all the illustrations myself as well.
